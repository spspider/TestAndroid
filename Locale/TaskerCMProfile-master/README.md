# TaskerCMProfile

This is a plugin for
[Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm)
to switch betweeen Cyanogenmod's profiles.

With the update to CM12.1 and later the existing solutions for this
don't seem to work any more, so I wrote this plugin instead.  It uses
the new
[Cyanogenmod Platform SDK](https://github.com/CyanogenMod/cm_platform_sdk)
as well as the localeapi library by
[two fourty four a.m. LLC](http://www.twofortyfouram.com) and is based
on their
[Locale Toast setting](http://www.twofortyfouram.com/developer)
example.
